# Citi Bike Analysis: Location vs Popularity

I wanted to explore if there was a relationship between the most popular bike station IDs and the location they were in.
I also wanted to explore the inverse: if there was a relationship between the least used bike stations and their location.
To accomplish this, data from the past three years were analyzed to uncover any trends.
Maps were then created for each year and placed side to side in a dashboard to more easily see the trends and similaries between the datasets.

The first dashboard shows that the most popular bike stations every year were in a cluster and the locations didn't vary much from year to year.
These maps were created by changing the view to streetview, which allows you to see things of interest near your plotted data, such as streets or train stations.
When you zoom in on any of the maps provided, you can see that the most popular locations were right by areas with high foot traffic, such as parks or train stations, suggesting they were conveniently located.

A city map was also created with zip code data overlaid on it, and it showed that population density was highest where the most popular stations were located, suggesting another reason for their popularity was simply because more people were present in the area.

The least popular bike stations over the years were also mapped out to see if a visible trend could be seen. Sure enough, the least used bike stations were placed in locations were there wasn't much foot traffic, and were therefore less accessible to people.
